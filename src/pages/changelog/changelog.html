  <p>In this document find recorded the main changes that have been implemented. Note, whilst the web version will always be
    kept up-to-date there may be a delay between app store releases</p>

  <!-- 0.5.0 -->

      <p>
        <strong>New Database System</strong>
        <br> A new system has been implemented so that all data required to run the app is stored locally to work entirely offline,
        with additional methods created to update this data from a central database when internet access is available.
        <br>This will be useful for times when a new resource or survey is added but the user doesn't wish to download an entirely
        new version of the app
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Budget Tool Improvements</strong>
        <br> The budget tool has been given a significant overhaul, rebuilding the key interactions from the ground-up to be
        more accessible and reliable. This is still a
        <i>work in progress</i> but the main changes currently seen include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A new initial enterprise select page</li>
        <img src="assets/img/changelog/0-5-0_1.png">
        <li>Higher quality images (and more of them too)</li>
        <img src="assets/img/budget/cards/pigeon-peas.svg" style="width:120px">
        <p>These are now rendered as SVG images which means they are created mathematically and can be scaled up to any size</p>
        <li>Sharing of custom images</li>
        <p>The new database system has been implemented so that user-created cards are also stored locally and shared</p>
        <br>The system will soon be extended to include optional sharing created budget templates.
        <li>Improved budget overview sizing, navigation links and improved data binding</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Core platform updates</strong>
        <br> A lot of the core components have undergone an update to improve code maintainability and quality (the larger the
        project gets the more important that things are structured in a sensible, efficient way). A number of components
        are still being actively worked on and so may not behave exactly as expected, but most issues should be resolved
        within the next minor updates.

        <strong>WhatsApp Groups</strong>
        <br> The app now provides a direct link to whatsapp groups for discussion topics. Different groups will be created for
        specific cases and made available only to those relevant. An initial 'App Feedback' group has been created and can
        be joined by all.
      </p>
      <whatsapp-group [group]="whatsAppGroup"></whatsapp-group>
      <p>
        <strong>Translations</strong>
        <br> The app now has the functionality to translate text into local languages. A full list of text still needs to be
        build and translated, but you can see an example of the system in action below:
      </p>
      <div style="background-color:gray; padding:5px; margin-bottom:1em;">
        <language-select></language-select>
      </div>
      <div>{{'How are you?' | translate}}</div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- 0.4.0 -->
  <div class="log-item">
    <div class="log-title">
      <h2>0.4.0</h2>
      <div>13th June 2018</div>
    </div>
    <div class="log-updates">
      <p>
        <strong>App Changelog</strong>
        <br> This page has been added to the app to help keep anybody interested in the app more aware of what has been happening
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Improved web version</strong>
        <br> The web version is now offline-ready. All files required are loaded in the background and cached to work offline
        and save bandwidth when revisiting.
        <br> When the app is updated a new version is downloaded in the background, and once successful a message will appear
        to load the updated version.
      </p>
      <p>The web version can be viewed at:
