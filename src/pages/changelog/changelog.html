        <strong>WhatsApp Groups</strong>
        <br> The app now provides a direct link to whatsapp groups for discussion topics. Different groups will be created for
        specific cases and made available only to those relevant. An initial 'App Feedback' group has been created and can
        be joined by all.

        <strong>Translations</strong>
        <br> The app now has the functionality to translate text into local languages. A full list of text still needs to be
        build and translated, but you can see an example of the system in action below:
      </p>
      <div style="background-color:gray; padding:5px; margin-bottom:1em;">
        <language-select></language-select>
      </div>
      <div>{{'How are you?' | translate}}</div>
    </div>

      <p>
        <strong>App Changelog</strong>
        <br> This page has been added to the app to help keep anybody interested in the app more aware of what has been happening
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Improved web version</strong>
        <br> The web version is now offline-ready. All files required are loaded in the background and cached to work offline
        and save bandwidth when revisiting.
        <br> When the app is updated a new version is downloaded in the background, and once successful a message will appear
        to load the updated version.
