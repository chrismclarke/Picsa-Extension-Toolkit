      <strong>Improved web version</strong>
      <br> The web version is now offline-ready. All files required are loaded in the background and cached to work offline and
      save bandwidth when revisiting.
      <br> When the app is updated a new version is downloaded in the background, and once successful a message will appear to
      load the updated version.
