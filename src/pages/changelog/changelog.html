        <strong>WhatsApp Groups</strong>
        <br> The app now provides a direct link to whatsapp groups for discussion topics. Different groups will be created for
        specific cases and made available only to those relevant. An initial 'App Feedback' group has been created and can
        be joined by all.

        <strong>Improved web version</strong>
        <br> The web version is now offline-ready. All files required are loaded in the background and cached to work offline
        and save bandwidth when revisiting.
        <br> When the app is updated a new version is downloaded in the background, and once successful a message will appear
        to load the updated version.
